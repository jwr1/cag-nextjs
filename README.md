# CAG-MainWebsite
Welcome to CAG's main website repository. Thank you for being apart of something that will touch many people for the glory of God! Please read everything below to get started.

## Guidelines (Subject for Change)
Here are some guidelines to follow that will help you get started and also help us as a team to work better together!
#### - !!!!DOCUMENT YOUR CODE!!!!
I can not stress how important this is. Please provide easy to understand comments and if needed documentation for the code you right. We are working as a team and it is important that everyone can understand what you write.
#### - Don't commit bad code
Basically don’t upload code that is not complete or has issues. Meaning if you are currently working on a section of code and have not completed it, don’t commit it to GitHub. Leave it on your machine until you have finished so that other people don’t have to try to figure out how to finish it. If you need help and want to commit to get assistance from everyone, comment out your code so that the rest of the site can execute without issues then leave a post in the Discussions section.
#### - Use proper naming, arranging, and formatting.
I will later provide official documentation on proper formatting but for now just make sure you arrange and format code so that us humans can easily look at it and see what's going on ;)
#### - Communication
As a team communication is key to developing a successful project. Please use your team chat and blogs here on GitHub to communicate back and forth. DO NOT use other platforms such as SMS, IM, or Email for conversation about this project. All discussions must be held here so that others can see and learn.

## Structure
### Branches
 - "master": Holds code being stablized for release.
 - "release": Code live on site.

## How to get started
### Recommended Software
The nice thing about code is that its flexible. And us programmers like flexibility!! So feel free to use whatever IDE you please but I will post what I use here.
- IDE: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Plugins: Live Server, HTMLS CSS Support, Material Icon Theme
- Git: Git obviously ;)

### Before you get the code
Before you start changing code and fixing issues, please reach out to me on Slack. All changes should go through me before assigned. DO NOT work on code unless you are assigned to the issue or feature.

### Get Code
1. Clone into repository: git clone https://github.com/Cornerstone-Church/CAG-MainWebsite.git
 
## Upload to branch
Please upload all your code to a branch that is your username in this way: 'user-silentsonata'. If that branch does not exist feel free to create it. If it is an issue create a branch labeled 'issue-NameOfIssue' so that way everyone can see the code fixes for that issue.

## Request branch upgrade
Code uploaded to does not automatically get uploaded to the web servers. In order for code to be moved to the servers you must create a Pull Request to master. All code must be synced with master before getting sent to release.
1. Click Pull Request on GitHub repository site.
2. Click "New pull request".
3. Choose your branch changes ("master" <- "user-silentsonata").
4. Name your request with a description.
NOTE: Requests without a description will most likely not be approved.
5. Submit and wait for approval from an admin.

Together for Jesus!
